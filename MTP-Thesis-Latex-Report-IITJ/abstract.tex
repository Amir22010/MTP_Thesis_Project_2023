The project will propose an AI model which does aspect-based sentiment analysis. In this project I have implemented and shown an aspect-based sentiment model trained on using different aspects extraction strategy and applying automatic annotation on online hospital reviews dataset extracted via web scraping from \href{www.mouthshut.com}{mouthshut website}.
\\
To evaluate, I have taken an online hospital reviews text data from for some hospitals and extracted its important aspects and sentiments using custom fine tuned intruct based text geneartive model. I have also compared the training and evaluation results achieved by the open-source text generated model taken as a base model to do fine tuning on different annotated text data.
\\
I will also share the predicted outputs for samples test data by the model trained on different aspects and sentiment extracted strategy annotated data.
